I develop analysis systems for multidimensional medical datasets that
include imaging. While most of my work focuses on the human brain, I
have also contributed to the Allen Brain Atlas, Waxholm space,
non-human primate studies and studies of other organ systems such as
the heart and lung. This

summarizes my topics of research. I achieve my research goals with
open-source projects, [ANTs](http://www.picsl.upenn.edu/ANTS/) and
[ANTsR](http://www.picsl.upenn.edu/ANTsR/) (answer), which help us
disseminate knowledge. I am also a founder and developer of the [Insight ToolKit](http://www.itk.org), a medical image processing library used throughout academia and industry.
