I develop robust tools to help standardize and understand medical
images in relation to other data.  While most of my work focuses on
the human brain, I have also contributed to the Allen Brain Atlas,
Waxholm space, non-human primate studies and studies of other organ
systems such as the heart and lung. This

summarizes my topics of research.

I achieve my research goals with open-source projects,
[ANTs](http://stnava.github.io/ANTs/) and
[ANTsR](http://stnava.github.io/ANTsR/) (answer), which help us
share our ideas freely. I am also a founder and developer of the
[Insight ToolKit](http://www.itk.org).

You may reach me through stnava + gmail.
