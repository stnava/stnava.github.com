I contribute robust tools to help standardize and understand medical
images in relation to other data.  Modern medical imaging captures the
dynamic states of the heart or brain in individuals or across
populations.  With the appropriate data science and analytics tools,
we can use imaging to optimize personal health, identify
targets for brain-based intervention studies and measure normative
values for brain connectivity, blood flow and other aspects of the
living brain.  Ultimately, these [techniques] (http://brianavants.files.wordpress.com/2013/05/avants_wordcloud.jpg) will guide methods that help the brain adapt to stress, injury, aging,
disease and the environment.

My research is implemented via open-source projects,
[ANTs](http://stnava.github.io/ANTs/) and
[ANTsR](http://stnava.github.io/ANTsR/) (answer), which let us
share our ideas freely. I am also a founder and developer of the
[Insight ToolKit](http://www.itk.org).  These three pieces of software
work synergistically and are used throughout academia and industry.
